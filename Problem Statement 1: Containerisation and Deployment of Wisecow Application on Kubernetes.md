To achieve the objectives outlined in Problem Statement 1, we'll follow these steps:

### Dockerization:
1. **Dockerfile Development**: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Wisecow application. Ensure it includes all necessary dependencies and instructions to build the application within the Docker container.

### Kubernetes Deployment:
2. **Kubernetes Manifests**: Craft Kubernetes manifest files (e.g., Deployment, Service) to define how the Wisecow application will be deployed and accessed within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Implement a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to automate the build and push of the Docker image to a container registry whenever changes are committed to the repository. Additionally, configure continuous deployment to Kubernetes following successful image builds.

### TLS Implementation (Challenge Goal):
4. **TLS Configuration**: Ensure that the Wisecow application supports secure TLS communication. Configure TLS certificates to enable encrypted communication between clients and the Wisecow application.

### Expected Artifacts:
5. **Private GitHub Repository**: Set up a private GitHub repository containing:
   - The source code of the Wisecow application.
   - The Dockerfile for containerization.
   - Kubernetes manifest files for deployment.
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions workflow).
   
### Access Control:
6. **Public Repository**: Adjust the GitHub repository settings to be public, as specified.

### End Goal:
7. **Successful Deployment**: Ensure that the Wisecow application is successfully containerized, deployed to the Kubernetes environment, and accessible via a Kubernetes service. The deployment should be automated through a CI/CD pipeline, and TLS communication should be enabled for security.

By meticulously following these steps and ensuring each requirement is met, we can achieve the end goal of containerizing, deploying, and securing the Wisecow application on Kubernetes with an automated CI/CD pipeline.
